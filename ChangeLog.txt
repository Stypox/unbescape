1.1.6.RELEASE
=============
- Added class org.unbescape.Unbescape in order to report the version of the library being used.
- Added support for unescaping (ignoring) line continuators (\ + LF) in CSS and JavaScript literals.
- Set compilation baseline to Java 6.
- Added "Automatic-Module-Name: unbescape" to MANIFEST.MF for Java 9+ JPMS.

1.1.5.RELEASE
=============
- Fixed unescaping of some HTML5 NCRs (Named Character References) which are allowed to be specified without
  a semicolon-char suffix (e.g. "&nbsp").
- Added to XmlEscape specific methods for performing escape operations on XML attribute values. These methods will
  always perform the escaping of the \t, \n and \r characters to avoid a possible loss of information when the XML
  document is read by a parser, as according to the XML spec at https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#AVNormalize all
  these three characters would be normalised to white-space.

1.1.4.RELEASE
=============
- Added ampersand (&) to the list of characters to be escaped in LEVEL 1 for JSON, JavaScript and CSS literals
  in order to make escaped code safe against code injection attacks in XHTML scenarios (browsers using XHTML
  processing mode) performed by means of including XHTML escape codes in literals.

1.1.3.RELEASE
=============
- Improved performance of String-based unescape methods for HTML, XML, JS, JSON and others when the
  text to be unescaped actually needs no unescaping.

1.1.2.RELEASE
=============
- Added support for stream-based (String-to-Writer and Reader-to-Writer) escape and unescape operations.

1.1.1.RELEASE
=============
- Fixed HTML unescape for codepoints > U+10FFFF (was throwing IllegalArgumentException).
- Fixed HTML unescape for codepoints > Integer.MAX_VALUE (was throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBounds).
- Simplified and improved performance of codepoint-computing code by using Character.codePointAt(...) instead
  of a complex conditional structure based on Character.isHighSurrogate(...) and Character.isLowSurrogate(...).
- [doc] Fixed description of MSExcel-compatible CSV files.


1.1.0.RELEASE
=============
- Added URI/URL escape and unescape operations.
